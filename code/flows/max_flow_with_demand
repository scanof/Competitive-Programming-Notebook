feasible flow in a network with both upper and lower capacity constraints, no source or sink: capacities are changed to upper bound — lower bound. Add a new source and a sink. let M[v] = (sum of lower bounds of ingoing edges to v) — (sum of lower bounds of outgoing edges from v). For all v, if M[v]>0 then add edge (S,v) with capacity M, otherwise add (v,T) with capacity -M. If all outgoing edges from S are full, then a feasible flow exists, it is the flow plus the original lower bounds.
maximum flow in a network with both upper and lower capacity constraints, with source s and sink t: add edge (t,s) with capacity infinity. Binary search for the lower bound, check whether a feasible exists for a network WITHOUT source or sink (B).
